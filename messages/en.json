        "title": "The Birth of Seder",
        "subtitle": "Seder was born from a word — and a path.",
        "p1": "Beyond the acronym of my initials — Skouri David Raphaël — Seder (סדר) embodies a fundamental philosophy: that of Order. The idea that even what seems complex — a relationship, a decision, an event, a project — can become clear, structured, mastered. And above all: peaceful.",
        "p2": "My journey was built on a dual requirement, at the highest level: artistic requirement and business requirement.",
        "p3": "I am an artist, an Andalusian singer of Moroccan origin, a Hazan, and a performer for religiously connoted events. And a great artist is never “simply” an artist: he already lives in rigor, precision, detail, mastery of emotion and execution. It is this artistic discipline that prepared me to understand excellence — and then to transpose it into the business world.",
        "artist_label": "Visit my artistic website.",
        "artist_link": "https://raphaelskouri.com",
        "p4": "Because I was very present in the community, and because my relationships were naturally built in circles of influence, I was gradually entrusted with responsibilities that went far beyond the stage. I was asked to organize events (weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, celebrations), to manage situations where everything had to be perfect, discreet, fluid. I was also entrusted with responsibilities related to real estate: apartments to manage, service providers to coordinate, decisions to take. And over time, I also took charge of everything related to hospitality, concierge services, and lifestyle: welcoming, foreseeing, securing, anticipating, ensuring that life was simple for very demanding people.",
        "p5": "These experiences gave me a central competence: a real organizational capacity, forged in the field, in contact with very high standards — in events, hospitality, concierge services, and real estate.",
        "p6": "I lived for several years in the United States, which expanded my network and strengthened my learning. Initially, these doors opened out of kindness: they saw me as an artist. Then the relationship became much deeper: I was given total trust, missions, decisions to make, sometimes even the management of entire teams during their travels. I learned business from people who succeeded — by integrating their method, their mentality, their standards.",
        "p7": "In parallel, my place at the heart of the community also put me at the center of human dilemmas, sometimes very tense. I often played the role of mediator: calming, understanding, restoring trust, finding a fair outcome, and creating an agreement. This capacity led me to study and understand the psychology of relations, decisions, and power dynamics — a fundamental pillar of what I have become.",
        "p8": "It is exactly this that gave birth to Seder: the rare synthesis between artistic excellence, business requirement, event organization, hospitality/lifestyle concierge, real estate, and mediation.",
        "p9": "Today, in Israel, I am solicited for these same reasons: reliability, discretion, ability to move forward, and aptitude to deliver a result in contexts where many fail. Seder Group is not an idea: it is the culmination of a real experience, structured into a union capable of serving — and achieving — at the highest level.",
